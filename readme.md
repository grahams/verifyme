My fingerprints and public keys from various crypto products, all signed
using my GPG key.

My voice is my passport...

My preferred methods of comms, in order:
1. Signal
1. iMessage
1. Keybase
1. Whatsapp

If you must use GPG/PGP for comms, the pubkey is provided here.  Please use one of the other methods, if you are able.  I use GPG for signing commits and data, not so much for comms.
