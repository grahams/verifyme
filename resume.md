## Expertise
I have brought multiple commercial applications from napkin sketches, through prototypes, to shipping and selling multiple millions of dollars.

I have grown these applications from being the initial individual contributor to managing and mentoring a team of engineers.

I have helped existing teams with decades of loose, ad hoc practice and process move into a modern, distributed, collaborative model, resulting in a maintainable, stable platform and improving the experience for our own team as well as customers.
